# java-common-utils
A collection of common utilities I find myself writing for most Java projects

### Arg Parser
This is a simple yet powerful Java CLI arg parser. It takes a collection of all possible arguments, and using the 
args provided in the CLI, will do some intelligent parsing and validation, then return you the subset of your 
Arguments which was input to your program.


### Files
Who hasn't written their own comfort lib for parsing files yet?


### Logging
I hate the built-in logging, I find it too limiting, and the output formats are typically yukky.
I also hate how complicated 3rd party libraries are to integrate with a similar level of complexity.
This attempts to be a wholly self-contained logging extension library to make logs way more pleasant.


### Models
Why import the whole of Apache Commons, when I need the basic functionality from around 1% of them?
